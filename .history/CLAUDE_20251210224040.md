# Agent Specification

Grounded in the PRD for the Slack‑like multi‑agent AI chat app. This document defines the initial agent types, roles, behaviors, and state hooks to align the system before implementation. Update as the session-state tool and UI details evolve.

Prod itself, refer to `docs/PRD.md`
